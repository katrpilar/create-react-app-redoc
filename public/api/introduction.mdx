The Setster API is used to control your accountâ€™s data programmatically. The API is organized around REST and standard HTTP verbs. A consistent envelope is used for all responses alongside response codes to indicate the status of the message and any error codes. JSON is returned on all our API responses with a consistent structure for all messages.

In order to use the Setster API you will need the API key that you can find within your Setster account and note you should never expose your API key in any public website's client-side code. The Setster API works on HTTPS only.
