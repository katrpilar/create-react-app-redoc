## Requirements

-   [ ] Confirm Node v10.13.0 is installed and being used in your project directory
-   [ ] Confirm NPM is installed
-   [ ] Confirm Yarn is installed
-   [ ] [Clone the setster-widget repo](https://github.com/boxador/setster-widget)
-   [ ] Install dependencies
-   [ ] Start app

### __1. [Install Node v10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.13.0/)__   
Your machine may already have a pre-installed version of Node. However, you may need to install the `v10.13.0` version which is required for creating a Setster Booking Widget.

#### Check Node Version
In the terminal for your project, the following command should list what version of node you're currently using. If it doesn't print your current node version then you'll need to install Node.

In your terminal run:
```
node -v
```

##### Install Node
If the above command does not print out a node version you'll need to install Node.

##### Switch Node Version
If you already have Node installed, but it's the not right version it's advisable to use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) (Node Version Manager) to switch the `v10.13.0` Node version from your project directory.

Once nvm is installed you can install the `v10.13.0` version and switch to using it in your project by running:
```
nvm install v10.13.0
nvm use v10.13.0
```
Then, confirm the correct Node version is selected by running:
```
nvm list
```
or
```
node -v
```

ℹ _Now you will be able to easily install and switch between different Node versions using nvm._


#### [Confirm NPM Installation](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
Npm should automatically install on your machine upon installing node. In your terminal run this command to check if it is properly installed:
```
npm -v
```
If this command does not return the npm version [debug and install npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

#### [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
We'll be using yarn to install our dependencies, but this can also be done using npm.

To install Yarn run:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Then check the installed version of yarn with this command in your terminal:
```
yarn -v
```

## Local Setup

The first step to getting started using Setster to solve your complex scheduling needs is to create an account. The intuitive onboarding will walk you through adding all of the details about your business, locations, services, and staff that are a core component of developing your custom scheduling experience.

### Clone the setster-widget repo found here

### Install dependencies
Move inside the new created folder after you cloned the repo. From inside the folder you need to run the following commands from the terminal:
```
yarn install
```

### Start app
After everything is installed you can either start the widget in development mode or build the widget. When building the widget, the code will be minified and concatenated and everything will be moved inside the “build” folder. All files from the “build” folder can be moved to a server which will have to serve the app.html file (or you can open the file in a browser). That is the entry point of the widget. When testing it is better to start the widget in development mode. This will create a web server and serve the widget from https://localhost:8081

```
#Build
yarn build:staging
 
#Run in development mode
yarn start:dev
```
