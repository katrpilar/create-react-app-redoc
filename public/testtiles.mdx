## Tiles
This step can be used to show a grid of tiles from which the user can select. This step can be a multi tile select step or a single tile select step.

## Image Map
This step can be used to create an image map. It is used to create different click-able areas on an image. This will allow to create a more visual experience for different approaches (selecting a parking lot, a seat at a table, etc.). Note that this is a presentational step and it is not tied down to the availability. For the example of parking lots, if a lot is selected on a previous appointment, we can’t show it as taken.

This step can be used to show the locations that are defined in Setster on a Google Map. This step is tied down to Setster API and it fetches information from Setster. When using this step, you have to also define the “googleMapOptions” parameter.

## Filters
Filters are a way to filter the result fetched from Setster. They are available as a parameter on the following step types: ‘locations’, ‘locations-map’, ‘services’ and ‘staff’. Filters are being applied to the step inside which they are defined. We will start with a full example and describe what each parameter does and after that go over some other examples of use.
