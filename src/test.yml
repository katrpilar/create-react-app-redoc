  title: Setster Scheduling API
  description: |
    The Setster API is used to control your accountâ€™s data programmatically. The API is organized around REST  and standard HTTP verbs. A consistent envelope is used for all responses alongside response codes to indicate the status of the message and any error codes. JSON is returned on all our API responses with a consistent structure for all messages.

    In order to use the Setster API you will need the API key that you can find within your Setster account and note you should never expose your  API key in any public website's client-side code. The Setster API works on HTTPS only.

      description: "The first step to using the Setster API is to authenticate to an account. Authenticate your account by including your key and email in an API request. In the returned response, the session_token should be used for all future API calls. Please note the session_token expires within 24 hours at which you need to re-authenticate and retrieve another session_token to keep the connection open."
